# Covid case Study
Machine Learning case study 

This is one of my projects working with a non-regressive database. The database was found on kaggle as the other ones.
In this project I could exercise my skills in machine learning and data science in general.

The case study consisted of researching informations on internet (additional information about viruses from the dataframe as well as definitions of various blood rates)
After the exploratory data analysis I managed to preprocess the data and find several interesting pipelines and models that I could then, in part 3 (covid_modeling) develop
and explore the hyperparameters. Finally, a good f1 as well as recall scores were found.
During all the work period, many notes were taken, as well as partial conclusions helping me to continue my researches.
